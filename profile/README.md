## Getting Involved
If you want to support our work, our good first tasks are found in [this GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/HenselForCongress/projects/4). These tasks are designed to help you get started with contributing to our projects and making a meaningful impact.


## Repositories

### [Sunbeam](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/sunbeam)
Sunbeam is an innovative tool for instantly reporting campaign finance data publicly, ensuring transparency and accountability in political campaigns.

### [References](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/references)
This repository contains references and schema files essential for our various projects.

### [Ghost Vote](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/ghost-vote)
A custom flavor of Ghost's Casper theme for henselforcongress.com, enhancing our campaign's web presence.

### [ISP Docs](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/isp-docs)
**Note:** This repository is not official. It is a MKDocification of the ISP WordPress posts for better documentation and access.

### [Financial Discloser](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/financial-discloser)
A Rust-based application dedicated to downloading financial disclosure reports in PDF format and generating an index based on data from specific government repositories. This project is useful for researchers and analysts who need organized access to these documents for further analysis. It is very much a work in progress.

### [Daylight](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/daylight)
An app that interacts with Sunbeam to stage data before submitting it to the FEC, essentially an improved version of FECFile without reliance on Microsoft.

### [Jack](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/jack)
An app designed to help manage the signatures needed to access the ballot. Now that the campaign is on the ballot, this project is depricated.
